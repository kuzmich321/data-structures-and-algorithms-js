What is a binary heap?

Very similar to binary search tree, but with some different rules!

In a MaxBinaryHeap parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

MAX BINARY HEAP
- Each parent has at most two child nodes
- The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
- In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be
and left children are filled out first
