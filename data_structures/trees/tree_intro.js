What is a tree?

A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

Lists - linear
Trees = nonlinear

A Singly Linked List (sort of a special case of a tree)

Tree Terminology:
- Root      =>  The top node in a tree
- Child     =>  A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- Parent    =>  The converse notion of a child
- Siblings  =>  A group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf      =>  A node with no children
- Edge      =>  The connection between one node and another

Examples:
- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Trees
- AI
- Folders in Operating Systems
- Computer File Systems

KINDS OF TREES:
- Trees (can have not limited amount of children)
- Binary Trees (can have only 0-2 children)
- Binary Search Trees (sort of binary trees)

HOW BSTS WORK:
- Every parent node has at most 2 children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a prent node is always greater than the parent
