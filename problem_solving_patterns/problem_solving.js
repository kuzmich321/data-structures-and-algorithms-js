1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

1.1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
1.2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
1.3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
1.4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? I.e., do I have enough information to solve the problem?
(You might not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay.
It's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
1.5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

2.1. Start with Simple Examples
2.2. Progress to More Complex Examples
2.3. Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
2.4. Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

3.1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering
conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details as well
